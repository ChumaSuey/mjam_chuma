Merged Data Logs
J (Data Log #0451): Hey Daelon, hope you're doing well. Can we stop hiding things in the high pillars? It's getting annoying. Also, I hope we get to fix the stair rubble. I know we found a weird teleporter, to heaven or wherever it goes, but it's been a pain walking to the factory through the normal entrance.

Dana (Data Log #0777): Derrick, I know we decided to hide the Golden keycard from the deposit area in the factory boxes. But why did we have to hide the platinum key deep inside the pool? I'm starting to think it has to do with that Green armored "Power Ranger" He helped us clean up the weird demon plague in the base. Anyway, I don't think a wooden plank will stop anyone from getting the silver keycard besides ourselves.

Kevin (Data Log #0898): Arty, I know we've been hiding stuff in the upper parts of our buildings, but why are we hiding a nuclear-type weapon on the outpost rooftop? That's not safe in any way! Seriously, I'm scared of that green reaper guy, Slayer, or whatever he's called. But we didn't have to resort to these unsafe extreme practices. It's as stupid as setting up emergency drones in the rest lounge that come out of the window.

Arthur (Data Log #6969): Sayu, the other day Kelsea badly stepped into the rubble and somehow came out of the sky! That teleporter below the stairs should be locked down soon! P.S. Be careful with that red flying monster pet the green guy left. I'm not sure if it was given back, but that guy scares me! He brutally killed our colleagues JUST WITH HIS HAND!
